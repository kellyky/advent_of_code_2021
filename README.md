Advent of Code 2021!! 

README is 100% still in progress, as I'm figuring it out as I go. But, here's where I am as of 12/4. 

* I've attempted Day 1 Part 1
* I've created a skeleton file that contains code that allows me to turn input file into an array each day
* day-creator.sh is a rough start at something to automate the skeleton folder/files for each day

## Advent of Code
Following along with Advent of Code exercises. https://adventofcode.com/2021

I'll probably stick to Javascript for the exercises. But we'll see!

## How to Use Day-Creator
As of 12/4 :-)

1. Copy/download/clone the file to the root of your directory
2. `chmod +x day-creator.sh` so you can run it

Currently, you have to edit the file daily to update the day -- e.g. `day_2 to day_3`.

I do hope and plan to automate this a bit, and I have a couple ideas in mind:
* Set it to prompt user input, and write that into the day number (if that's feasible)
* Or,  possibly write the day-renaming into the file (if possible) and connect it to my chrontab to run daily
